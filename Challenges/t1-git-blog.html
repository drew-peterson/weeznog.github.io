    <h3>Describe version control</h3>
      <p>
        Version control System (VCS) is an umbrella name referring to programs that run on your computers command line. The purpose of a version control system is to allow the user to track changes they make to files. Word will track your last save and maybe the time before that, but a version control system will track every save you have made and will give you the ability to recover to the save point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Version Control Systems combined with github(see below) are also useful when working on one project with many people. These people can be located anywhere in the world, working on the same project, even the same file. Everyone has their personal copy of the project. They create branches which are copies of the master project. Branching allows them to make changes without affecting everyone elses project. When the individual is satisfied with their changes they merge their changes with the master allowing others to see their work and update their project with anothers changes.

    <h3>Explain How git tracks changes</h3>
      <p>
        Git is the name of a particular VSC program that runs on your computer. Git does everything you would expect from a VSC, track changes, check status, push/ commit changes. Git differs from other VSC in how you actually go about tracking changes and pushing new content. generally all commands (words you type into git allowing you to track changes and such) begin with the word "git". From here you can add secondary keywords to accomplish your goals. For instance to see what changes you have made to files type: git status. To create a new branch type : git checkout -b branch-name. Other VSC systems will have others ways to accomplishing tasks as outlined above, I have no experience with them so i cannot comment...

      <h3> Evaluate the benefits of using github to store code</h3>
        <p>
         Github is a website dedicated to letting its users save and share code in one place. There are many other websites that allow you to share and save code, however it seems github is currently the most popular.
        </p>
        <p>
          Github is a good place to store code because it acts like a secondary VSC. All the final updates you make on git will be displayed on github, giving you another way to track changes on the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          While github is a good place to store code, it really shines in giving you the tools to share your code easily with others. As mentioned above, combined with a VCS such as git, multiple people can work on the same project, adding and modifying files as they go. Github store the master copy of the project. As people make changes in their own copys of the master project called branches, they can push their changes to the master branch in github. Once the changes have been added to the master branch in github other people working on the same project can download those changes to their copy of the master, this way everyone is up to date.
