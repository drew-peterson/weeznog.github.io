  <h1>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h1>

      <h3>Pairing</h3>
      <p>
      I used to be really nervous about pairing. It helped that my first pairing session went very well. I paired with a Person who teaches summer school so he was very open minded and laid back which I find very helpful for a pairing session. Since my First the majority of my pairing sessions have been a positive experience. My really only down pairing session happened because we both had opposite learning and thinking style and we both struggled to explain X in a way that other understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solving challenges as a pair has its ups and downs. Its hard to do the driver navigator because It the navigator tends to be under the burden of solving the problem and the other just sits there. I would like to see the driver take control when they have an idea and the navigator sortof think about it and do research while the other is trying to explain what they are doing/ thinking.
      </p>
        What the pair is working well together and communication is good that makes life alot easier. Its rewarding when a pair shoulds you a pieice of code or method that makes sense that accomplishes something you have struggled with in the past. But for the most part there might be alot of silence as we are trying to figure out the best approach.
      <p>
      <p>
        As I mentioned above, it very hard to work with people that are uninterested, unwilling to change and adapt, or just have different thinking and learning styles with makes understanding eachother difficult. Its also very difficult when the navigator has the idea and the driver is just typing. Its a break down in communication that I deffinatly need to improve on.

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>
      Getting to the point of actually reading Feedback is the hardest. But actually reading it you generally feel better. I am often nervous about feedback because I have an idea of how the I acted during the pairing session. Most of the time I beleive I do a good job, not brilliant just good... But I worry that the other person doesnt see it that way. However when someone does point out something that goes against how I orignally thought, I feel sad for a secound and then start agreeing and trying to do better next time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feed back can most deffiantly be helpful, i rather enjoy feedback even if it does make me nervous. However Most feedback that is most helpful is the negative kind I find. Tell someone they did a good job is nice, however It's not helpful, i want someone to tell me what I can improve on. I pick up better ways of doing X from the pair, but its also nice to hear about something I did not consider. Most of the time People do not give me something I can improve on. It makes me feel good "hey maybe I didnt do anything wrong" but at the same time "I still want to get better, grrrr"
      </p>
      <p>
        incorporating feedback you receive is not generally hard to actually do, its hard to remember to do. Often pairing sessions can get stressfull, and you fall back on your old bad habits. Its not hard to for example say " I am looking on line 49", but It is hard sometime without practice to actually remember to say the line instead of just going on about something and the pair is wondering what you are talking about. I just read some feedback, that I half agreed with, I annoying when the person makes it sound likes it your fault when I feel they are equally to blame, but underneith it all there is a grain of truth and something I been to incorrportate in my next pairing session.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because I want to improve, I am often disspointed when people do not point out things that I do wrong. So When it my turn to give feedback I always try to give them some helpful critisim. Sometimes its hard to give critisim because I felt the pairing session went really well. If i see something I think could help them, I will point that out. But sometimes finding something to point out can be the challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        overall pairing in ruby is hard. I think its hard because the driver navigator roles are wonky OR we are not using them correctly. I want to improve on being a driver navigor by making the driver be the person with the idea and the navigator doing research and spell checking and such... Pairing in CSS was easier because that was typing in syntaxs not solving problems...
