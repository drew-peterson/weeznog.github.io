      <h3><small>what is an enumerator?</small></h3>
      <p>
        Enumerator is a term used to describe a grouping of methods whose jobs is to sort, add/remove, find and alter information stored in a Collection Object. As far as I know the two most common forms of a collection objects are arrays and hashes.
      </p>
      <p>
        All enumerators have the basic functioning of an <code>.each{|element|block}</code> enumerator method. The <code>.each</code> method goes 1 element at a time passing the element to the block and returning the value. lets look at an example:
        <br><code class="block">
          fruit = ["apple", "orange", "lime"]
          <br>
          <br>
          fruit.each{|element| element.upcase!}
          <br>#=> ["APPLE", "ORANGE", "LIME"]
         </code>
      </p>
      <p>Many types of enumerator methods to accomplish different tasks however each method will in some way go 1 element at a time and do something to that element.

      <h3><small>Using group_by</small></h3>
      <p>
        <code>.group_by{|element|block}</code> is a method that can be called on collection object. Each element is passed to the block as a parameter. The block goal is to organize elements into a hash based the value returned from the block. A hash has 2 properties, keys and values. The key would be the return value from passing element to the block. The value will be an array of elements that match the key.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code class = "block">
          names = {
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"drew" => "College",
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evan" => "Highschool",
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reed" => "College",
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jim" => "Middle School"
        <br>}
        <br>
        p names.group_by{|name, school| school}
        <br>{
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"College"=>[["Drew", "College"],["Reed", "College"]],
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"HighSchool"=>[["Evan", "HighSchool"]],
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Middle School"=>[["Jim", "Middle School"]]
        <br>}
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        <br><b>note:</b>How the keys are all the values from the previous hash and the values include the keys from the previous hash along with the values. Unfortunatly group_by takes each key, value pair and places them in their own array. We can clean this up with additonal code, but the most important thing to remeber from <code>.group_by</code> is it always returns a hash. And the key will equal the return value of the black. Value will equal an array of the entire element that match true for the return value.
      </p>
      <p>If you want to return 2 arrays, the 1st array containing the elements that return <code>True</code> for the block, and everything else in the 2nd array, check out <code>partition</code>.
