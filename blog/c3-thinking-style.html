      <h3 class = "article-header">Abstract sequential and random</h3>
      <h3><small>How best to help others</small></h3>
      <p>
        I find myself reading down the list of items on the website <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm"> Mind styles by Anothny Gregorc</a> and nodding quite a lot. Abstract sequential and random complement eachother very well. For example, Abstract Sequential likes his/her point to be heard, however an Abstract Random like to listen to others. I could continue going down the list finding characteristics that balance eachother other, but I will just sum everything by saying I am a rather flexible individual. Being such a flexible individual can do wonders in group situation because I can potentially adapt depending on what is needed. Now, I dont really have any practice at being flexible in a group learning situation, but that is why were are here, to learn and better ourselves. Everyone has different ways to approach everything, I find that many people are stuck thinking only one way and do not accept others points of views, or even consider that other people have differerent points of views. My most powerful assest is that I put effort into understanding others views, working together requires collaboration and you cannot do that if you are not willing to bend...

      <h3 class = "article-header">Reflection Time</h3>
      <h3><small>Thinking style and struggles</small></h3>
      <p>
        My Time with DBC so far has gone rather smoothly. I came here already having studied Git, CSS, HTML, Ruby, Javascript and JQuery by myself so this has been a good review. I expect the review feeling to continue for atleast another week maybe 2. Once we get into unknown territory my thinking style will be put to the test, and I can start hashing out what has and has not worked.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Biggest Struggle</b> so far has been not applying things I have learned by myself to the task at hand. Right now we are doing basics and I need to work on the basic instead of taking shortcuts with advancted techniques that we are not supposed to have learned yet. And actually forcing myself to do the basic's has resulted in a much better final result. I tend to want to copy expert websites when I am only a novice. forcing myself to complete the task with specific tools has lead to a better understanding.

      <h3 class = "article-header">Growth vs Fixed mindset</h3>
      <h3><small>Improving myself</small></h3>
      <p>
        Improving how I learn and think will be an on going learning experience. However I have already identified that I need to work on forcing myself to do something I don't want to do. On the list of Growth Mindset, I am not sure where this falls on a scale of difficulty, but I am going to assume everyone is different. I know for a fact that over time I will be less anxious and I will be better at doing things I do not want to do. I am not at that stage yet so its difficult, but getting easier. All we can do right now is ID our struggles and accomplishments and apply them to getting better at understanding ourselves. This is week 3, I am going to assume that understanding ourself is something that will take a life time, but atleast we are starting down that path now so we are bond to improve.
