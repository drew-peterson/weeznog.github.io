    <h3>Based on the video, what is your take on the DBC experience </h3>
      <p>
        The DBC experience is focused on you learning the code needed to take a first step towards being a developer, as fast as possible. Because people will be learning new things everyday, DBC wants to create an enviornment were people are not afraid to ask questions and work together to solve problems. In school I remember when the teacher asked does anyone have a questions, now one wanted to be the first one to raise their hand. At DBC trying to make students students feel ok about raising their hand about things they do not know.

    <h3>What is your impression of DBC?</h3>
      <p>
         If you look at the professional sporting world their are many different types of coaching styles. The two that come to mind are yelling in someones face or guiding someone with kind words. Differnet styles work for different people. I find that when someone is talking to you with tones of understanding and caring, I feel better about myself and my ability to ask questions and learn. DBC feel's like the type of place that when I ask a easy question, in my head I am screaming "drew you should know this", the teacher is not going to put on a disgusted look on their face but instead teach me the proper way of doing something. Unforutantly I have alot of anxiety, I am hoping the enviornment leads to less of it...

    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging in this type of culture</h3>
      <p>
        It's going to be really hard. I am not used to sharing and letting other people see what I am doing. Its going to be a hard adjusting, but something I am looking forward to getting better at.

    <h3> Have your expectations changed?</h3>
      <p>

          Not really, I choose this camp because of the environment. Though I think people that are interested in learning code most likely have more in common with myself then someone who is working on a construction yard. Seeing how people communicate via google+ makes me feel their are most people like me.
      </p>
    <h3>Are you excited about the environment, does it make you nervous?</h3>
      <p>
          I am exicited at the thought of interacting with people without feeling anxious. I am very nervous, everyday, all day, its terrible, but you have to work though things and they get better. Its just hard to keep pushing though when you continue to feel anxious without it getting better.
