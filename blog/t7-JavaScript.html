  <h1>Ruby vs Javascript</h1>

      <article class>
      <h3 class = "article-header">Overall Impressions of Javascript</h3>
      <p>
        I though Javascript added logic and iteraction with our website. Currently we have not been introduced to this aspect of javascript yet. What we have covered so far seem to be a review of what we have learned in Ruby but with different rules and syntax. Now Javascript and Ruby as similar to many ways. They if loops, iterators, arrays, booleans, variable scopes, math and methods to name a few. While all this items operate similar to how they would in ruby, the syntax is the first thing I found different. Instead of <code>do..end</code> they have <code>{ }</code>. instead of <code>def function_name() end</code> they have <code>function name(){};</code>. I could go on and on, however today I wanted to focus on Ruby classes vs javascript constructors.
        <br>
        <br> I was really surprised when we ran across constructor functions early in the week. As we created them I had no idea what they were supposed to do. It was not until we printed some values to the screen that the light bulb moment came about -- "hey these similar to ruby classes..."

        The above code does exactly the same thing, one is done is javascript the other in ruby. Everyting is in the same order so you can match code side by side.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a list breakdown of the major differences
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>this.name</code> is acting simliar to the <code>@name</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is no <code>class</code> keyword in javascript, you, the <code>this.X</code> within a function hints that this function is  constructor function. Also the name is capitalized.
          </li>
          <li>
            a function inside a function that is assigned to a variable is called a <i>method function</i> in ruby declare a method inside a class is just a method.
          </li>
          <li>
            to access variables outside a ruby class you must assigned them to <code>attr_Reader :name, :qty</code>. for Javascript its alittle more lineant and you can access them with just <code>.</code> notation
          </li>
          <li>
            printing items to the console in ruby is down with <code>puts, print or p</code> in javascript the only way I know how to do it is w/ <code>console.log()</code>
          </li>
        </ul>

      </p>

      <h3 class = "article-header" >Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        I like Ruby better, its seems closer to speaking english, which is what the invenetor intened it think. I also like that ruby seems to have alot more methods avaiable to iterate and extract information for hashes and arrays. Javascript has methods, but they are limited and they tend to do funny things sometimes. You also have to be very carefull w/ syntax in javascript and majority of my errors are syntax erros and the compiler is not always friendly with how it tells you were the errors are....
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking forward to seeing how ruby and javascript are applied to websites and apps further down the line. I Know how javascript and later jquery add iteration to websites, just no idea how ruby comes into play.
