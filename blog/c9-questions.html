  <h1>Asking Good Questions</h1>

    <article class>
      <h3><small>Who do I ask when i have a question?</small></h3>
      <p>
        I have never posted questions to the community, and most likely never will. When I dont understand something I am quick to do a google search, and often those questions have already been answered or something close to it has been answered. So I am going to talk 1st about when my google searches do not return the needed results and posting pairing sessions to the community.
      </p>

        <h3><small>Google search</small></h3>
        <p>
          Over the years I have leanred what google search likes and doesnt. I often find that if I type in a question that that is closer to sub human speak I get a good result. Sub human speak I guess is referring to partial sentences that are specific but not gramitcally correct. for example "office chair back tilt not going backwards" instead of "My office chair does not tilt backwards when i try, what should i do?". I think google is just looking for key words do If you think about the minimal specific words you used ask, google will narrow down the results better.
        </p>

        <h3><small>when google search fails</small></h3>
        <p>
          The only time I find that google fails is when I do not know the specific words needed to return the correct results. For example if I wanted to ask a question about my xbox one controller not working, and i didnt know the offical name for what the controler is commonaly called: do a google search on "my xbox remote does not work" will return results on an xbox 360 tv remote, not the controller I am looking for. <b>When google fails</b> try to think of everything related what you are asking to force google to split out the correct word. So "my xbox A button does not work" will probably return someone talking about the "xbox controller", and then you can use the keywords to do your more acurate search.
        </p>

        <h3><small>Posting Pair's invites: do's and don'ts</small></h3>
        <p>
        I want to give people all the information so they can make a descision without writting too much in my invite. I often write things out in bullet format w/ time that work days of the week and specific challnges. I have found that people often choose one of the challenges not both to pair on. I say "yes" and we schedule a time. I then make a change to my original post with updated times.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>dont update posts and expect to get pairing invite on 2nd challenge</b> when people see that somone has already commented on your post they don't dive into it and see if you only have 1 challenge met. Tip, just close your post and create a fresh new one with my updated schedule and challenge info.
        </p>

        <h3><small>Conclusion</small></h3>
        <p>
         I think asking a good question is like doing a good google search. Be specific, breif and ready to ask a follow up when you get more information. reading the links on asking a good question has made me feel good because I already do exactly what they reccomend. However I have experienced alot of people in my pairing sessions that are unwilling to act questions, unwilling to ask a following up or unwilling to answer my questions. The first 2 I can compeletly understand, I suffer from anxiety and try and help those people feel uncomfortable, but there are some stubborn people that refuse to take the time to answer my questions, and then look discusted when you dont get it. Those people suck, I hope they do poorly...
         <i>I canot really be bothered to write anything more, note sure if I like blogging every much...</i>
