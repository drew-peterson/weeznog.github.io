  <h1>Values</h1>

      <article class>
      <h3><small>Values in Life</small></h3>
      <p>
        When I look back at when I am happiest, it often involves:
        <ul>
          <li>Adventure</li>
            <ul><li>Traveling Somewhere, setting out to find something new(often involving food)</li></ul>
          <li>Location </li>
            <ul><li>exploring a new location. Often the weather plays a role extreme (rain,snow,sun)</li></ul>
          <li>Sharing</li>
            <ul><li>share the adventure with people, so you can talk about it later. And also sharing new places, foods, experiences with people that are excited about it.</li></ul>
        </ul>
        I would say I would like to live up to these values more often. They are a rare combination, which is why I am happiest when they come together. But currently I am probably at a 2.

      <h3><small>Why is Adventure Important</small></h3>
      <p>
        Its weird to say I am happiest when I am Aventuring, because I often do not just randomly try new things that I am not interested in. For me to be adventours It would have to be something I care about. This is not just a general adventuring, but often involves food, exocitic locations and hunting for something specific. For instance, when I did a study abroad in the czech republic, me and my room mate were just wondering around trying to find somewhere to eat. We found this indian resturant down some random ally in a random part of the city behind this gigantic gothic church. It was the best indian food I have ever had. Later when My family came I wanted to take them to this resturant. However this time I was at night, blizzard conditions, and I was coming from a direction I had never been(the hotel we were staying at). We trudged through the blizzard, my family was cold and hungry but I wanted to show them the resturant, it was an adventure. The locatino matters too, prauge is an ancient european city that feels like you are lord of hte rings or something, combined with blizzard conditions and the need for food, it felt like a movie. It also helped that I was sharing something I enjoyed with people I knew would also enjoy the food.

      <h3><small>Advice</small></h3>
      <p>
        The last topic someone asked for advice on was computers. I always help my realitives with computer problems, helping them over remote desktop. A neighbor needed help so I went over and helped them. I got paid which was nice, though truthful I dont really like helping people that do not put effort into something. These people were stuck in the old ways and refused to try to learn why i thought a new method was better for the computer problems... No this did not meet the values components...
