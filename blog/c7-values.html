  <h1>Sterotype Threat</h1>

      <article class>
      <h3><small>Introduction</small></h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>sterotype threat</b> - refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group or social id.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>social id</b> - the part of personal identiy, out sense of who we are, that comes from our group membersship and the social categories to which we belong (age,sex,race,religon,progression,ethnicity,nationality..)
          </li>
        </ul>

      </p>

      <h3><small>What is a Sterotype?</small></h3>
      <p>
        Sterotype threat for the most part is referring to a self induce sterotype that results in negative outcomes for yourself. However you can also sterotype others, and because of those sterotypes you interact with them a certain way, this interation affects you and the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most often sterotypes are a negative thing to have. However there is a reason why sterotype exists. People's sterotypes of a snake is that they are dangerous. Now not all snakes are dangerous, but there are defintaly some that can kill you. In this case our sterotype of snakes can come in handy. We see something that looks like a snake, sterotype pops in our head "snakes are bad", we leave the snake alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        There has always been talk about sterotypeing black teeangers that wear hoodies and baggie pants and bad people. The reason why this sterotype exists is that there are many people that are bad that also wear hoodies and baggie clothing. Does the snake sterotype come into play here? Should we avoid people that wear clothing that matches sterotype assocated with violence? It is not entirely fair to the individual wearing such clothes. Unfortunatly Human life is alot more complicated then that of a snake. And it is not always fair to judge people based on their appearance.
      </p>
      <h3><small>Why is sterotype threat bad?</small></h3>
      <p>
        Take this fictional example: A sterotype floating is that people with blue eyes having trouble tracking fast moving objects. I have blue eyes and today at PE we are playing baseball. Its my turn to bat, I have been told that I have trouble seeing fast moving objects, the baseball being thrown at me is a fast moving object, how am I supposed to hit the baseball, when I have already been told its hardrer for me to hit the baseball, I dont even try... As far as I know people with blue eyes do not have tracking problems. But you can see how a self imposed sterotype is setting you up for failture not success.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Another more realistic example:</i> I have a math test today, I am a women, women are not good at at math, so I will most likely dont do good on my math test. This narative has been talked about for decades, women are not good at math. When you understand Sterotype threat a question you can ask yourself if you are a women is, why cant i be good at math? I understand there is a sterotype, is that sterotype true, I suppose it up for me to decide that but I will not give up on math.
      </p>

      <h3><small>Personal Experience with stero type threat</small></h3>
      <p>
        I am a white male. For some reason, and maybe this is because I am a white male, I am not aware of any sterotypes about white males that applies to use as a whole. Most Likely sterotypes exist and I just ingnore them because culturally I have been taught that what we call sterotype threat should be ignored when I comes to being a white male in America. Does the following sentence sound American? "You can do anything if you set your mind to it". What picture comes to mind, for me its a father talking to his son, when his son says I want to be a astronaute. Do other Culturals, races, sexes have this built in slogan, almost like something that is built into your DNA? I would say no, BUT those times are changing as we become more aware.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Anxiety</i> - Something that I identify with, something that unfortanley always seems to sneek on the list of things that defines me. Growing up I was not aware of anxiety, all i knew is that when it came to test taking I would get nervous and I would do poorly on tests. When it came to Homework i got 100% when it came to Tests I got C - F's, so i told myself I was bad at tests. Unfortanly the US school system is set up to gaudge knowledge with tests. When I am bad at tests, how can I ever go to a good college. It was not until my senior year in college that I figured out why i struggled with tests and steps to take that helped with my anxiety and lead to better test results. My senior year in college I got almost all A's. 15+ years of telling myself I am bad a tests, developing habits and life long minds sets around situations that make me feel anxious. Now that I am out of school, I get pludged into another wolrd jobs and interviews and day to day life. Anxiety unforuntally has contolled my world, and I am only now learning to deal with it. Other people have had 15+ years jump start, but then i tell myself that I have 15+ years jump start on things that because they didnt live with anxiety, they never experienced.
