  <h1>Conflict - Personal Experience</h1>

    <article class>
      <h3><small>Ignoring people...</small></h3>
      <p>
        Freshman year in college, we lived in what was called a "cluster". on the main hallway, their were many doors, some door lead to single bed rooms other lead to clusters. A cluster is a common area shared among 3-5 additional people. So our cluster was called 255B, inside we have a couch with 2 chairs, a tv and a door. That door near the comman area held 1 room with 2 people. Further inside the cluster would be a bathroom, and 3 more rooms, 1 single room and 2 more double rooms. I lived in one of those double rooms with a roomate. luckily that roomate left so I had a double room all to myself! I enjoyed my time with that cluster, I am still friends with several of the people that I lived with, however there was one individual called Grant that I could not stand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grant really enjoyed drinking, smoking and playing loud music. He would often try to break into my room as I was going to sleep and just act drunk. He would never listen to me when i ask him to leave and he never cared if he was being too nosiey or dirty(he would leave beer and pizza everwhere...) I just got really tierd of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          After freshman year was over I moved out of the cluster and into a single apartment. I honestly do not remember anything about this year, which is kind of scary. I do remeber Grant always calling me but i never picked up. It went on for months, he would call i would ignore. I just didnt want anything to do with him. He annoyed me so much freshman year that I just wanted to be done with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I continued to ignore him I also began worrying about running into him on campus. I started taking random routes to classes just to avoid the possiblibilty to running into him. At this point I had been ignoring him for atleast 3-4 months, and he still continued to call me. It got to the point that everytime the phone rang i would get really nervous that it was grant.
        </p>

        <h3><small>Resolving Conflict</small></h3>
        <p>
          I do not really remeber how I resolved my conflict with Grant, However to my best guess, I had become so sick of being nervous that I took action and just picked up the phone when Grant called one day. Either that day or sometime down the road we ended up at a chinese resturant called golden teriyaki. I dont remeber Grant being mad, he didnt call me out, he didn't yell, he was just happy to talk with someone from freshman year. It turns out that I was the first person he had talked to since everyone seperated after freshman year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grant is one of those people that sucks to be around when he is surrounded by other people that are similar to him. However get him away from those people, Grant is a person that likes food and adventuring. Sometime I can completly relate too. And as I sat their in Golden Teriyaki, i felt bad to Grant, I felt guilty to ignoring him. It seems we have more in common that I thought, and that away from Alchol Grant could be a fun person to hang out with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grant and I continued to hangout, we would go on food eating adventures, buy groceries, play video games and watch movies together. Junior Year in college we got a 2 bedroom apartment very far away from campus and had a good time. I think that summer I went to Maui with Grant to work for his dad over the summer. Senior year We went to Prague together and traveled around Europe as a study abroad group. Too this day we are still in contact. I do not consider Grant a perfect friend, but he is a good friend and I know that If I was going to go on an adventure again he would be on the list of people I would like to include.

      <h3><small>Conclusion</small></h3>
      <p>
        I honestly would not do anything differently. Because i dont actually remember all the details. Its a bad story, but I am still proud of the fact that I got over my dislike for someone and gave them a chance, and i turns out we had more in common then i thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its easier to become friends with someone if you start out with both likely something similar. Its alot harder to overcome the intial assumption that this individual is nothing like me. Often People in a group act differently, is it worth giving them a chance? I suppose so, however It has been my experience that when people gather alcholo is often involved, and i hate alcholol, and what it does to people. So I would often avoid these get together all together. When I decline offers to join people dont like that and I am often pushed outside any social circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        People often never give me a chance, and i often never give them one, however I suppose I am still waiting for the honest person.
