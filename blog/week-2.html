  <h1>Week 2</h1>
  <h2>Postions: Relative, Absolute, Fixed</h2>
  <h3></h3>
  <img src="../position-img.png" alt="position image" class="position-img">

    <h3>Relative</h3>
      <ul>

        <li>The element will be intially be placed exactly where it would have been placed within the normal work flow.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>You can then move the element using specific key words (top, bottom, left, right) with a combination of lengths of measurement (px, em, %).</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For example: you want to move the block with the class relative no where just to see where it lands in the work flow. See image to right ---></li>
          <ul>
            <li> <b>English translation:</b>for the block with the class 'c' position realtive to where it would exist in the work flow and do not move it. Notice how it is positioned in the upper left hand corner, this is exactly where it would have landed if i did not apply a position property. Also notice how the static block is placed below it. The static block represents a block without a positioning property.
          </ul>
        <li>Moving outside the containing div will not affect placement.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Absolute</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>when the positioning property is given a value of absolute. the element is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of others elements. they act like they are not there.</li>
          <ul>
            <li> Example: for the block with the class c I want it to the right of both the static and relative blocks and then move it down from the top a bit.</li>
              <ul>

                <li><b>English translation:</b>/for the block with the class D give is a property of absolute, which will take it out of the work flow. move it from the left of the screen 190px to the right and move it from the top of the screen 40px down.
              </ul>
          </ul>
      </ul>

    <h3>Fixed</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Type of absolute positiong that positions the element in relation to the browser window. Therefore, when a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>example: for the block with the class B place the block at the very bottom of the screen and move it right maybe half way, when i scroll my mouse above or below the black i dont want it to move</li>
            <ul>
              <li><b>English translation:</b>for the block with the class of B give it a position of fixed, so it stay in the exact same spot on the screen. position it 0px from the bottom and from the left move it 200px to the right.
              <li>**The height will be important later if you have alot of content above it.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
